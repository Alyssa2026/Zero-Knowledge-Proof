As we were testing, we found and resolved some small bugs, which was very helpful!

# Documentation

We made sure to add lots of in-line comments to our three-color-graph.frg file to try to explain the logic behind our predicates. We hope that this makes it easy to understand our model. However, running the model with the visualizer is also a good way to understand what our project is aiming to express.
